# 🍕Pizza Sales Analytics

An end-to-end data analytics project designed to transform raw pizza sales data into meaningful business insights using Python, SQL, and Looker Studio.

This project demonstrates my ability to design databases, analyze data, and build interactive dashboards — mirroring the complete workflow of a real-world data analytics project.

# 🚀Project Summary

## The Pizza Sales Analytics project highlights a complete data analytics pipeline:

## Data Generation (Python):
Created realistic, synthetic pizza sales data to simulate a restaurant’s order system, including customers, order details, and menu items.

## Data Modeling (SQL + ERD):
Designed and implemented a relational database schema with an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to define data relationships and structure.The model also incorporates ingredient inventory and cost tracking to enable detailed profit margin and supply chain analysis.

## Data Analysis (SQL):
Performed detailed SQL queries to uncover key performance indicators (KPIs) — top-selling items, order trends, and customer preferences.

## Data Visualization (Looker Studio):
Built an interactive dashboard to visualize performance metrics and insights in real time.
