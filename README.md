# 🍕 PizzaStore Sales Analytics

An end-to-end data analytics project that simulates and analyzes pizza sales data to uncover key business insights. This project demonstrates the full data analytics pipeline — from **data generation** to **visualization** — using Python, SQL, and Looker Studio.

# 🚀 Project Summary

The Pizza Sales Analytics project showcases a complete analytics workflow:

### Data Generation (Python):
Synthetic datasets were created to simulate pizza orders, customer behavior, product details, ingredient usage, and storage information.

### Data Modeling (SQL + ERD):
A relational database schema and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) were developed to structure sales, inventory, and cost data. This ensures accurate tracking of ingredient usage, storage, and cost impacts on profitability.

### Data Analysis (SQL):
SQL queries were used to uncover key performance metrics, including:

Sales trends by item type, category, and time period

Inventory usage and storage efficiency

Customer ordering patterns and revenue contribution

Data Visualization (Looker Studio):
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize KPIs such as total revenue, high-margin products, top-selling items, inventory insights, and operational trends.

### 🧠 Key Insights

🍕 Top Performers: Highest-revenue pizzas and categories identified.

🧂 Inventory & Cost: Ingredient usage tracked to optimize storage and reduce waste.

💰 Profitability: Margins analyzed by integrating sales and ingredient cost data.

🕒 Operational Trends: Peak order times.

### ⚠️ Limitations & Future Improvements

While the project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow, some simplifications were made:

Ingredient Representation: Each pizza item is currently linked to a single ingredient ID. Future work could include multiple ingredients per pizza for more accurate cost and inventory analysis.

Time Analysis: Sales trends were analyzed by time of day only. Extending analysis to include days of the week or months would provide richer operational insights.

Additional Metrics: Advanced profitability metrics, customer segmentation, or predictive sales forecasting could further enhance the analysis.
